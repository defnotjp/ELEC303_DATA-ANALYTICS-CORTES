    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Load and explore a real-world dataset\n",
    "- Prepare data for linear regression (feature engineering, encoding, cleaning)\n",
    "- Train a simple linear regression model using `scikit-learn`\n",
    "- Evaluate your model using metrics like R² and interpret results\n",
    "- Make predictions for future years (e.g., 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 Dataset\n",
    "You are given the file: `Data Science Salary 2021 to 2023.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains salary information for data professionals from 2021 to 2023, including:\n",
    "- `work_year`: The year the salary was recorded\n",
    "- `experience_level`: EN (Entry), MI (Mid), SE (Senior), EX (Executive)\n",
    "- `job_title`: e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.\n",
    "- `salary_in_usd`: Salary converted to USD (this is your target variable)\n",
    "- Other useful columns: `employment_type`, `company_location`, `company_size`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: **Predict average salaries for 2024** using linear regression."

    "1. The model's predictions are likely inaccurate because a basic Linear Regression relies too heavily on simple features such as the year and general experience. Key factors are being ignored.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The primary issue is that salaries are determined by more than just location and company size. The model overlooks the impact of geographic location. A Data Scientist in a major city like San Francisco earns significantly more than one in a smaller city, even with comparable experience. Also, larger, well-funded companies often provide better compensation than startups.\n",
